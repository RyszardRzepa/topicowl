MOST IMPORTANT INSTURCITONS TO FOLLOW:
Think cerfully and only action the specific task I have given to you with most consise and elegant solution that changes as little code as possible.

Never use type "any", its not allowed in this project.
Never run cli command 'npm run dev'. 
Don't create new files or helpers in the `src/lib` directory. Write all business logic directly in the files where it is needed. 
New types: write common types in `src/types/types.ts` and colocated types in the API route files.
Dont create scripts files for testing.
Always use ?? insetead of ||.
