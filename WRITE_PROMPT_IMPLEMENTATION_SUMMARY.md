# Write Prompt Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented functionality to save the AI write prompt in the `article_generation` table when generating articles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- The `writePrompt` column already existed in the `articleGeneration` table as a `text` field
- Generated and ran migration `0030_nifty_shocker.sql` to ensure the column is properly added to the database

### 2. Write Route Enhancement ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/articles/write/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added logic to save the complete write prompt to the database when `generationId` is provided
- The prompt is built using the existing `prompts.writing()` function with all parameters
- Added error handling for database operations
- Added logging for successful prompt saves and failures

**Key Implementation:**
```typescript
// Build the complete prompt
const writePrompt = prompts.writing(
  {
    title: body.title,
    researchData: body.researchData.researchData,
    videos: body.videos,
    sources: filteredSources ?? [],
    notes: body.notes,
  },
  settingsData,
  body.relatedArticles ?? [],
  excludedDomains,
) + excludedDomainsInstruction;

// Save the write prompt to the database if generationId is provided
if (body.generationId) {
  await db
    .update(articleGeneration)
    .set({ 
      writePrompt: writePrompt,
      updatedAt: new Date()
    })
    .where(eq(articleGeneration.id, body.generationId));
}
```

### 3. Generate Route Update ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/articles/generate/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Updated the call to the write endpoint to include `generationId`
- This ensures that when articles are generated through the main generation flow, the write prompt is saved

### 4. Interface Update ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/articles/write/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Updated `WriteRequest` interface to include optional `generationId?: number`
- This allows the write endpoint to know when to save the prompt

## How It Works

1. **Article Generation Flow:**
   - When an article is generated via `/api/articles/generate`, it creates an `articleGeneration` record
   - The generation process calls the write endpoint with the `generationId`
   - The write endpoint builds the complete prompt and saves it to the database

2. **Direct Write Calls:**
   - If the write endpoint is called directly without a `generationId`, no prompt is saved
   - This maintains backward compatibility for any direct API usage

3. **Prompt Content:**
   - The saved prompt includes all parameters: title, research data, videos, sources, notes, settings, related articles, and excluded domains
   - The prompt is the exact same text that gets sent to the AI model

## Benefits

1. **Debugging:** Can see exactly what prompt was used for any generated article
2. **Optimization:** Can analyze prompts that produced good vs poor results
3. **Reproducibility:** Can potentially regenerate articles using the same prompt
4. **Analytics:** Can track prompt patterns and effectiveness

## Database Impact

- Adds text storage for prompts (typically 2-10KB per article)
- No performance impact on existing queries
- Optional field that doesn't break existing functionality

## Testing

- Created test script template in `test-write-prompt-saving.js`
- To test in development:
  1. Start dev server (`npm run dev`)
  2. Generate an article through the normal flow
  3. Check the `article_generation` table for the saved `writePrompt`

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Add prompt versioning to track changes over time
- Create analytics dashboard for prompt effectiveness
- Add prompt templates and reuse functionality
- Implement prompt A/B testing capabilities
