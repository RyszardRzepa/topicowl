# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Users need the ability to add custom notes to articles during the planning phase that will guide the AI throughout the content generation process. These notes should provide specific context, requirements, or information that the AI should incorporate when researching, outlining, and writing articles. This feature will enhance the quality and relevance of generated content by allowing users to provide domain-specific knowledge and requirements.

5. WHEN research is complete THEN the system SHALL have incorporated note-guided information into the research data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want my article notes to influence the article outline creation, so that the structure and key points align with my specific requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system creates an article outline THEN it SHALL consider the article notes alongside the research data
2. WHEN notes specify particular sections or topics to cover THEN the outline SHALL include those elements
3. WHEN notes mention specific angles or perspectives THEN the outline SHALL reflect those approaches
4. WHEN notes indicate target audience specifics THEN the outline SHALL be tailored accordingly
5. WHEN the outline is generated THEN it SHALL demonstrate clear influence from the provided notes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want my article notes to guide the writing process, so that the final article incorporates my specific knowledge and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system writes the article THEN it SHALL use the notes as additional context in the writing prompt
2. WHEN notes contain specific facts or data THEN the article SHALL incorporate this information appropriately
3. WHEN notes specify tone or style preferences THEN the writing SHALL reflect these preferences

5. IF the notes are long THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without UI issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to understand how my notes are being used in the generation process, so that I can optimize my note-writing for better results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide notes THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that notes will be used throughout the generation process
2. WHEN generation is complete THEN I SHALL be able to see how my notes influenced the final content
3. WHEN notes are not being used effectively THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on how to write better notes
