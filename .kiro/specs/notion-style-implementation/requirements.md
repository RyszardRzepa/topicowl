# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves updating the entire application to implement the Notion-inspired UI style guide that has been defined in the steering documentation. The goal is to transform the current generic styling into a cohesive, Notion-like design system that provides a clean, content-focused user experience with minimal contrast and subtle visual cues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a consistent Notion-inspired visual design, so that I have a familiar and professional content creation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any page in the application THEN the typography SHALL use Inter font family with the specified weights and sizes from the style guide
2. WHEN I interact with any UI element THEN the colors SHALL follow the defined color system with proper contrast ratios
3. WHEN I view the interface THEN the spacing SHALL follow the 8-point grid system consistently
4. WHEN I use the application THEN all components SHALL have the specified corner radius of 4px maximum

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all interactive elements to behave consistently, so that I can predict how the interface will respond to my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over any button THEN it SHALL show the appropriate hover state with 150ms transition timing
2. WHEN I focus on any interactive element THEN it SHALL display a 2px focus ring in accent blue color
3. WHEN I interact with form inputs THEN they SHALL follow the consistent styling and behavior patterns
4. WHEN animations occur THEN they SHALL use the specified timing functions and durations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the color system to be semantic and accessible, so that I can easily understand the interface and it works for users with different visual needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view text content THEN it SHALL maintain a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for body text
2. WHEN I see colored elements THEN they SHALL use the defined semantic color tokens appropriately
3. WHEN I view the interface THEN 90% of the UI SHALL remain grayscale with accent colors used only for interactivity
4. WHEN I use the application THEN accent blue SHALL be consistently applied to primary actions and links

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Tailwind configuration to support the style guide, so that I can easily implement consistent styling across components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use Tailwind classes THEN custom color tokens SHALL be available for all style guide colors
2. WHEN I apply typography classes THEN they SHALL match the exact specifications from the style guide
3. WHEN I use spacing utilities THEN they SHALL follow the 8-point grid system
4. WHEN I create new components THEN the design tokens SHALL be readily available through Tailwind

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing UI components to follow the new design system, so that the entire application feels cohesive and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use buttons THEN they SHALL implement the primary, ghost, and danger variants as specified
2. WHEN I view cards and panels THEN they SHALL use the defined elevation and styling
3. WHEN I see form inputs THEN they SHALL match the specified input styling
4. WHEN I interact with any component THEN it SHALL follow the consistent interaction patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the layout to support both default and full-width content modes, so that I can choose the optimal viewing experience for different types of content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view content THEN the default layout SHALL use a 680px content column
2. WHEN I enable full-width mode THEN the content SHALL expand up to 1180px maximum
3. WHEN I view text content THEN line length SHALL be limited to approximately 72 characters for optimal readability
4. WHEN I switch between layout modes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and maintain content hierarchy
