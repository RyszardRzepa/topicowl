# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds the ability for users to specify competitor website domains that should be excluded from article generation linking. Users can manage this blacklist during onboarding and in their settings, ensuring that generated articles do not link to competitor websites. This helps maintain competitive advantage and prevents inadvertently promoting competitors through content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to specify competitor domains during onboarding, so that my generated articles never link to competitor websites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in the onboarding flow THEN the system SHALL display a competitor domain blacklist configuration step
2. WHEN a user enters competitor domains THEN the system SHALL validate domain format and store them in the user's settings
3. WHEN a user completes onboarding with blacklisted domains THEN the system SHALL save these domains to their profile for use in article generation
4. IF a user skips the competitor domain step THEN the system SHALL proceed with an empty blacklist

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my competitor domain blacklist in settings, so that I can add or remove domains as my competitive landscape changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their settings page THEN the system SHALL display a competitor domain blacklist management section
2. WHEN a user adds a new domain to the blacklist THEN the system SHALL validate the domain format and save it immediately
3. WHEN a user removes a domain from the blacklist THEN the system SHALL delete it from their profile immediately
4. WHEN a user views their blacklist THEN the system SHALL display all currently blacklisted domains in an editable list format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the article generation system to respect my competitor blacklist, so that generated content never includes links to blacklisted domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the outline API is called THEN the system SHALL retrieve the user's blacklisted domains and exclude them from link suggestions
2. WHEN the writing API is called THEN the system SHALL filter out any blacklisted domains from the provided sources
3. WHEN AI prompts are generated THEN the system SHALL include instructions to avoid linking to blacklisted domains
4. IF a blacklisted domain appears in research data THEN the system SHALL exclude it from the final article content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want domain validation and helpful feedback, so that I can correctly configure my competitor blacklist without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a domain THEN the system SHALL validate it follows proper domain format (e.g., example.com, www.example.com)
2. WHEN a user enters an invalid domain THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with format examples
3. WHEN a user enters a duplicate domain THEN the system SHALL prevent addition and show a warning message
4. WHEN a user enters a domain THEN the system SHALL normalize it to a consistent format (remove protocols, standardize subdomain handling)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the blacklist feature to integrate seamlessly with existing article generation workflows, so that performance and functionality are not impacted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN blacklisted domains are stored THEN the system SHALL use efficient database indexing for fast retrieval
2. WHEN article generation APIs are called THEN the system SHALL retrieve blacklisted domains with minimal performance impact
3. WHEN the blacklist is empty THEN the system SHALL proceed with normal article generation without additional processing
4. WHEN blacklisted domains are applied THEN the system SHALL log the filtering for debugging purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback about blacklist status, so that I understand how my settings affect article generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the blacklist in settings THEN the system SHALL show the count of blacklisted domains
2. WHEN a domain is successfully added THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message
3. WHEN a domain is removed THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message
4. WHEN the blacklist affects article generation THEN the system SHALL provide feedback about filtered links (in development/debug mode)
