# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Contentbot currently uses a kanban board interface for article management, but users find it complex and unclear for the two main workflows: article planning/generation and scheduling/publishing. This feature will redesign the UX to be clearer and simpler, focusing on making these two distinct flows more intuitive and user-friendly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want a clear and simple interface to create article titles and manage the article planning process, so that I can efficiently plan my content pipeline without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the main dashboard THEN the system SHALL present a clean, simplified interface with clear sections for article planning and scheduling
2. WHEN I want to create a new article idea THEN the system SHALL provide a prominent, easy-to-find "Add Article Idea" action
3. WHEN I create an article title THEN the system SHALL allow me to input just the essential information (title and optional keywords) without overwhelming form fields
4. WHEN I view my article ideas THEN the system SHALL display them in a clear list or card format that shows status and next actions
5. IF an article is in "idea" status THEN the system SHALL clearly show available actions (generate now or schedule generation)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to easily schedule article generation at specific times, so that I can plan my content creation workflow around my schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have an article idea THEN the system SHALL provide a clear "Schedule Generation" option alongside "Generate Now"
2. WHEN I choose to schedule generation THEN the system SHALL present a simple date/time picker interface
3. WHEN I schedule generation THEN the system SHALL clearly confirm the scheduled time and show it in the article's information
4. WHEN viewing scheduled articles THEN the system SHALL display upcoming generation times prominently
5. WHEN a scheduled generation time arrives THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger the generation process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to easily schedule article publishing after generation is complete, so that I can control when my content goes live.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an article generation is complete THEN the system SHALL present clear options to "Publish Now" or "Schedule Publishing"
2. WHEN I choose to schedule publishing THEN the system SHALL provide a simple date/time picker for the publish date
3. WHEN I schedule publishing THEN the system SHALL clearly show the scheduled publish time
4. WHEN viewing articles ready for publishing THEN the system SHALL display scheduled publish times prominently
5. WHEN a scheduled publish time arrives THEN the system SHALL automatically publish the article

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want a clear visual separation between the planning/generation workflow and the scheduling/publishing workflow, so that I can focus on the appropriate task without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL present two distinct sections: "Article Planning" and "Publishing Pipeline"
2. WHEN I'm in the planning section THEN the system SHALL focus on article ideas, generation status, and generation scheduling
3. WHEN I'm in the publishing section THEN the system SHALL focus on completed articles, publishing status, and publish scheduling
4. WHEN articles move between workflows THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback about the transition
5. IF I need to switch between workflows THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation between the two sections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want simplified article status indicators that clearly communicate what stage each article is in and what actions are available, so that I can quickly understand my content pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing articles THEN the system SHALL use clear, simple status labels instead of technical terms
2. WHEN an article is generating THEN the system SHALL show a clear progress indicator and estimated completion time
3. WHEN an article is scheduled THEN the system SHALL prominently display the scheduled date/time
4. WHEN actions are available for an article THEN the system SHALL present them as clear, prominent buttons
5. WHEN an article cannot be modified THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate why and what the next step will be

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want quick actions for common tasks like generating articles and scheduling, so that I can efficiently manage my content workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have multiple articles ready to generate THEN the system SHALL provide a "Generate All" bulk action
2. WHEN I want to set a default generation schedule THEN the system SHALL allow me to configure preferred generation times
3. WHEN I want to set a default publishing schedule THEN the system SHALL allow me to configure preferred publishing times
4. WHEN I perform common actions THEN the system SHALL provide keyboard shortcuts for power users
5. WHEN I complete an action THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and automatically update the interface
