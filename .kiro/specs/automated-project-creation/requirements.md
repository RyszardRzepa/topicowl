# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the new project creation flow by integrating the existing website analysis capabilities from the onboarding process. Instead of requiring users to manually enter company information, product descriptions, and keywords, the system will automatically extract this information from the provided website URL using AI analysis, similar to how the onboarding flow currently works.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user creating a new project, I want the system to automatically analyze my website URL and extract project information, so that I don't have to manually enter company details, product descriptions, and keywords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a website URL in the new project form THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze the website and extract company information
2. WHEN the website analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL populate the project form with extracted company name, product description, and keywords
3. WHEN the analysis fails THEN the system SHALL allow the user to proceed with manual entry as a fallback
4. WHEN the user submits the form THEN the system SHALL create the project with both manually entered and AI-extracted information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to review and edit the AI-extracted information before creating the project, so that I can ensure the information is accurate and complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display the extracted information in an editable preview
2. WHEN the user clicks on any extracted field THEN the system SHALL allow inline editing of that field
3. WHEN the user modifies extracted information THEN the system SHALL save the changes locally before project creation
4. WHEN the user is satisfied with the information THEN the system SHALL allow them to proceed with project creation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during the website analysis process, so that I understand what the system is doing and can wait appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters a website URL and triggers analysis THEN the system SHALL show a loading state with progress indication
2. WHEN the analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL display informative messages about the current step
3. WHEN the analysis completes successfully THEN the system SHALL transition to the review state
4. WHEN the analysis fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and fallback options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the new project creation flow to maintain the same user experience as the current onboarding flow, so that the interface feels consistent across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user interacts with the website analysis feature THEN the system SHALL use the same UI components and patterns as the onboarding flow
2. WHEN displaying extracted information THEN the system SHALL use the same preview and editing interface as onboarding
3. WHEN showing loading states THEN the system SHALL use consistent loading indicators and messaging
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use the same error handling patterns as onboarding

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the option to skip automated analysis and enter information manually, so that I can still create projects even if the website analysis doesn't work for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on the new project form THEN the system SHALL provide an option to skip automated analysis
2. WHEN the user chooses to skip analysis THEN the system SHALL show the original manual entry form
3. WHEN automated analysis fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to manual entry mode
4. WHEN in manual entry mode THEN the system SHALL allow the user to optionally trigger analysis later
