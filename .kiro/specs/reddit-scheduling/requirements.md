# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing Reddit integration to enable users to schedule Reddit posts for future publication. Users will be able to create posts that are automatically published at specified times, providing better control over their content marketing timing and allowing for strategic posting during optimal engagement hours. The feature builds upon the existing Reddit OAuth integration and follows the same architectural patterns used for article scheduling.
