# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update task generation API to support week-specific generation
  - Modify the existing `/api/reddit/tasks/generate` route to accept `weekStartDate` parameter
  - Update the existing task check logic to prevent duplicate generation for specific weeks
  - Ensure the API returns appropriate error messages when tasks already exist for the specified week
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Replace refresh button with generate tasks button in TaskCalendar
  - Remove the existing "Refresh" button from the TaskCalendar header
  - Add a new "Generate Tasks" button that calls the task generation API for the current week
  - Implement loading state management during task generation
  - Add error handling and success feedback using toast notifications
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Implement week detection logic in TaskCalendar
  - Add state management for tracking the currently visible week in TaskCalendar
  - Create helper function to calculate week start date from the current calendar view
  - Ensure the generate button always targets the currently displayed week
  - Update week navigation to properly update the current week state
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5_

- [x] 4. Create task overlap detection algorithm
  - Implement function to group tasks by time slots (hour-based grouping)
  - Create algorithm to detect which tasks overlap in the same time period
  - Calculate stack positions and overlap metadata for each task
  - Handle edge cases like tasks spanning multiple hours or partial overlaps
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Implement overlapping task card rendering
  - Modify task card positioning to support horizontal stacking offsets
  - Add CSS classes and styles for overlapped task appearance
  - Implement z-index management for proper layering of overlapped tasks
  - Ensure overlapped tasks maintain their interactive functionality
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 6. Add visual indicators for multiple overlapping tasks
  - Implement count indicator when more than 3 tasks overlap in the same slot
  - Add hover effects to bring individual tasks to the front when stacked
  - Ensure visual clarity when tasks have different durations but overlap
  - Test and refine the visual appearance of stacked tasks
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.5_

- [x] 7. Update task generation button integration
  - Integrate the new generate tasks button with the existing TaskCalendar component
  - Pass the current week start date to the generation API call
  - Handle the response from task generation and refresh the calendar view
  - Ensure proper error handling for various failure scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Test and refine overlap visualization
  - Create test scenarios with various overlap patterns (2 tasks, 3+ tasks, partial overlaps)
  - Verify that overlapped tasks remain clickable and draggable
  - Test the visual appearance across different screen sizes and zoom levels
  - Ensure accessibility compliance for overlapped task interactions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_
