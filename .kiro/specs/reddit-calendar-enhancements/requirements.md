# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Reddit task calendar interface to improve task generation workflow and visual representation of overlapping tasks. The enhancement focuses on replacing the refresh functionality with targeted task generation and implementing Google Calendar-style overlapping task cards for better time slot visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to generate Reddit tasks for a specific week, so that I can create targeted content schedules without affecting other time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Generate Tasks" button THEN the system SHALL generate tasks only for the currently selected/visible week
2. WHEN task generation is initiated THEN the system SHALL display a loading state on the button
3. WHEN task generation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL refresh the calendar view to show the new tasks
4. WHEN task generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message to the user
5. IF no week is currently selected THEN the system SHALL default to generating tasks for the current week

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to see overlapping tasks visually stacked like Google Calendar, so that I can easily identify time conflicts and task density.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple tasks are scheduled for the same time slot THEN the system SHALL render task cards overlapping each other
2. WHEN tasks overlap THEN each subsequent task card SHALL be offset slightly to show multiple tasks exist
3. WHEN hovering over overlapping tasks THEN the system SHALL allow interaction with individual task cards
4. WHEN tasks have different durations but overlap THEN the system SHALL position them to show the overlap relationship
5. WHEN there are more than 3 overlapping tasks THEN the system SHALL indicate the total count visually

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want the task generation to respect existing tasks, so that I don't create duplicate or conflicting content schedules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating tasks for a week THEN the system SHALL check for existing tasks in that time period
2. WHEN existing tasks are found THEN the system SHALL avoid creating duplicate tasks for the same subreddit and time
3. WHEN task generation encounters conflicts THEN the system SHALL either skip conflicting slots or suggest alternative times
4. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL provide feedback on how many tasks were created vs skipped

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want clear visual feedback during task generation, so that I understand the system is working and can track progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN task generation starts THEN the system SHALL disable the generate button and show loading state
2. WHEN generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators or status messages
3. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL re-enable the button and show success feedback
4. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL show error details and re-enable the button for retry
