# Multi-Organization Support Debugging Requirements

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical bugs and issues in the multi-organization support implementation that are causing users to be redirected to project creation pages and preventing proper data isolation. The system needs comprehensive debugging to ensure proper project context management, data fetching, and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with existing projects, I want to access my dashboard without being constantly redirected to project creation so that I can manage my content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with existing projects accesses any dashboard route THEN the system SHALL load their projects and set a current project context without redirecting
2. WHEN the project context is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states instead of redirecting
3. WHEN project context fails to load THEN the system SHALL show error messages and retry options instead of redirecting to project creation
4. WHEN a user has projects but no current project is selected THEN the system SHALL automatically select the first project instead of redirecting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my data to be properly filtered by project and user ID so that I only see my own content and not other users' data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint fetches data THEN the system SHALL filter by both user_id and project_id where applicable
2. WHEN fetching articles THEN the system SHALL only return articles belonging to the current user's selected project
3. WHEN fetching settings THEN the system SHALL only return settings for the current user's selected project
4. WHEN creating new content THEN the system SHALL associate it with the current user and selected project
5. WHEN switching projects THEN the system SHALL immediately update all displayed data to show only the new project's content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new user, I want the onboarding process to work correctly and create my first project without errors so that I can start using the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user completes onboarding THEN the system SHALL create their first project successfully
2. WHEN a project is created during onboarding THEN the system SHALL set it as the active project context
3. WHEN onboarding is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect to the dashboard with proper project context
4. WHEN an existing user without projects logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to project creation only once

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive debugging tools and tests to identify and fix project context issues so that the system works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging project context issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging of project loading and switching
2. WHEN testing data isolation THEN the system SHALL verify that users cannot access other users' data
3. WHEN testing project switching THEN the system SHALL verify that all components update correctly
4. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL verify proper project and user filtering

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the project switcher to work correctly and show accurate project information so that I can easily manage multiple projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project switcher loads THEN the system SHALL display all user's projects with correct names and URLs
2. WHEN switching projects THEN the system SHALL update the context immediately and persist the selection
3. WHEN creating a new project THEN the system SHALL add it to the switcher and make it the active project
4. WHEN a project is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove it from the switcher and switch to another project

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling and recovery mechanisms so that temporary issues don't break my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project loading fails THEN the system SHALL show error messages and provide retry options
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without breaking the UI
3. WHEN project context is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover by reloading projects
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL use cached data when available and show appropriate status indicators
