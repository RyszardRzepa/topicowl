# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to schedule when articles should be added to the generation queue based on predefined dates and frequencies. Users can create article titles with keywords, set scheduling frequencies, and control when articles move through the generation pipeline. The system will automatically add articles to the generation queue based on their scheduled dates, then process articles from the queue one at a time until empty, generating content and saving it as drafts for later review and publishing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to create multiple article ideas with titles and keywords, so that I can plan my content pipeline in advance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the article planning interface THEN the system SHALL display a form to create new article ideas
2. WHEN a user creates an article idea THEN the system SHALL require a title and allow optional keywords
3. WHEN a user submits an article idea THEN the system SHALL save it with status "idea" in the database
4. WHEN a user creates multiple article ideas THEN the system SHALL allow batch creation of up to 10 articles at once

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to set scheduling frequencies for my article ideas, so that they are automatically added to the generation queue at optimal times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an article idea THEN the system SHALL display scheduling options including date and frequency
2. WHEN a user sets a schedule date THEN the system SHALL validate the date is in the future
3. WHEN a user selects a frequency option THEN the system SHALL support one-time, daily, weekly, and monthly scheduling
4. WHEN a user saves scheduling settings THEN the system SHALL update the article status to "scheduled"
5. IF a user selects recurring frequency THEN the system SHALL calculate the next schedule time based on the pattern

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to move scheduled articles to a generation queue, so that I can control which articles are actively being processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views scheduled articles THEN the system SHALL display them in a dedicated "Scheduled" tab in the Content Workflow section
2. WHEN a user moves an article from "Scheduled" to "Generation Queue" tab THEN the system SHALL update the article status to "queued" and show a success notification
3. WHEN an article is in the generation queue THEN the system SHALL display its queue position and scheduled_for_date
4. WHEN a user moves an article to the queue THEN the system SHALL validate the article has required title and keywords

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want articles to be automatically generated based on their scheduled dates, so that content creation happens without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the current date matches an article's scheduled date THEN the system SHALL automatically add the article to the generation queue
2. WHEN an article generation begins THEN the system SHALL update the article status to "generating"
3. WHEN article generation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL save the content as a draft and update status to "wait_for_publish"
4. WHEN article generation fails THEN the system SHALL update status to "failed" and log the error
5. WHEN processing the generation queue THEN the system SHALL process articles one at a time in FIFO order until the queue is empty

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to monitor the status of scheduled and generating articles, so that I can track progress and identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the Content Workflow section THEN the system SHALL display articles in appropriate tabs based on their current status
2. WHEN an article is generating THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress indicators
3. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL display error information and allow retry options
4. WHEN a user clicks on a scheduled article THEN the system SHALL show scheduling details and next generation date
5. WHEN viewing the generation queue tab THEN the system SHALL display articles ordered by their queue position (FIFO)
6. WHEN an article status changes THEN the system SHALL show a notification confirming the status change and tab movement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to modify or cancel scheduled generations, so that I can adapt to changing content needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a scheduled article THEN the system SHALL allow editing of the schedule date and frequency
2. WHEN a user cancels a scheduled generation THEN the system SHALL update the article status back to "idea"
3. WHEN a user modifies a recurring schedule THEN the system SHALL update all future instances of the schedule
4. WHEN an article is currently generating THEN the system SHALL not allow schedule modifications
5. IF a user deletes a scheduled article THEN the system SHALL remove it from the schedule and update the database

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to manually override automatic scheduling limits, so that I can add extra articles when needed without disrupting my regular schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user manually schedules an article for a specific date THEN the system SHALL add it to the queue regardless of existing automatic schedules for that date
2. WHEN a user has an automatic schedule of "1 article per day" and manually adds 2 more articles for the same day THEN the system SHALL process all 3 articles
3. WHEN a user manually adds an article to the generation queue THEN the system SHALL assign it the next available queue position
4. WHEN processing the generation queue THEN the system SHALL process all articles regardless of whether they were added manually or automatically
5. WHEN a user views queue analytics THEN the system SHALL distinguish between manually and automatically scheduled articles

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the generation system to handle errors gracefully, so that failed generations don't block the entire queue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an article generation fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing the next article in the queue
2. WHEN multiple generation failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff for retries
3. WHEN the generation system encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
4. WHEN a generation fails after maximum retries THEN the system SHALL notify administrators via webhook or email
5. WHEN the system restarts THEN the system SHALL resume processing queued articles from their last known state
