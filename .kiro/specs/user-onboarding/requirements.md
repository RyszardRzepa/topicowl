# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The user onboarding feature provides a seamless registration and setup experience for new users of Contentbot. When users sign up through Clerk authentication, their data is automatically saved to the database via webhooks. New users are then guided through a simple onboarding process where they provide their website URL, which is analyzed by AI to understand their product and automatically configure their article generation settings.

2. WHEN the webhook receives a "user.created" event THEN the system SHALL extract user data (id, email, first_name, last_name)
3. WHEN user data is extracted THEN the system SHALL create a new user record in the database
4. IF the webhook is missing required headers THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error
