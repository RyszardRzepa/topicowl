# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an autonomous AI agent system for generating high-quality, SEO-optimized articles using Vercel AI SDK's `generateText` with tools and `maxSteps`. The system replaces the current orchestrator-based approach with a single autonomous agent that can research, write, validate, and optimize articles through intelligent tool usage while providing real-time progress tracking to users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want an autonomous AI agent to generate complete articles so that I can produce high-quality, SEO-optimized content without manual intervention in the generation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request article generation THEN the system SHALL create a single autonomous agent using `generateText` with tools
2. WHEN the agent starts THEN it SHALL automatically progress through research, writing, validation, and optimization phases
3. WHEN the agent completes all quality gates THEN it SHALL automatically finalize the article with all required components
4. IF quality gates are not met THEN the agent SHALL automatically apply corrections and re-validate
5. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want real-time progress tracking during article generation so that I can monitor the agent's progress and understand what phase it's currently working on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN article generation starts THEN the system SHALL create a generation record with initial progress state
2. WHEN the agent executes each tool THEN the system SHALL update progress percentage and current phase
3. WHEN I poll for status THEN the system SHALL return current progress, phase, and any relevant data
4. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL mark progress as 100% with completion timestamp
5. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL update status with error details and failure reason

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the agent to perform comprehensive research so that my articles are well-informed and based on current, accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent starts research THEN it SHALL use Google Search tools to gather comprehensive information
2. WHEN researching THEN the agent SHALL analyze SERP results, competitor content, and identify content gaps
3. WHEN research completes THEN the system SHALL store research data including sources, findings, and opportunities
4. WHEN research is insufficient THEN the agent SHALL automatically perform additional searches
5. WHEN research fails THEN the agent SHALL retry with different search strategies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the agent to write high-quality, SEO-optimized content so that my articles rank well and engage readers effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing begins THEN the agent SHALL use research data to create comprehensive, structured content
2. WHEN writing THEN the agent SHALL naturally integrate target keywords without keyword stuffing
3. WHEN writing THEN the agent SHALL create proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3) with keyword optimization
4. WHEN writing completes THEN the system SHALL generate multiple meta title/description variants with CTR scores
5. WHEN content is insufficient THEN the agent SHALL automatically expand or restructure the article

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the agent to validate facts and check links so that my articles maintain accuracy and credibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation starts THEN the agent SHALL fact-check all claims using Google Search verification
2. WHEN validating THEN the agent SHALL verify all external links are accessible and relevant
3. WHEN validation finds issues THEN the agent SHALL flag inaccuracies with confidence scores and suggested corrections
4. WHEN critical fact errors are found THEN the agent SHALL automatically apply corrections
5. WHEN link issues are found THEN the agent SHALL suggest alternative sources or remove broken links

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the agent to perform SEO audits so that my articles meet optimization standards and rank well in search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SEO audit runs THEN the agent SHALL analyze keyword density, distribution, and semantic coverage
2. WHEN auditing THEN the agent SHALL check content structure, readability, and technical SEO elements
3. WHEN audit completes THEN the system SHALL provide a score (0-100) and categorized issues (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
4. WHEN critical SEO issues are found THEN the agent SHALL automatically apply fixes
5. WHEN SEO score is below 90 THEN the agent SHALL continue optimization until threshold is met

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the agent to select appropriate images and generate schema markup so that my articles have complete visual and technical optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image selection starts THEN the agent SHALL search for relevant, high-quality images based on article content
2. WHEN selecting images THEN the agent SHALL generate appropriate alt text for accessibility
3. WHEN schema generation starts THEN the agent SHALL create JSON-LD markup for Article schema
4. WHEN finalizing THEN the agent SHALL ensure all images have proper attribution and licensing
5. WHEN schema is complete THEN the system SHALL validate the markup structure

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the agent to have quality gates so that only high-quality articles are marked as complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking quality gates THEN the system SHALL verify SEO score ≥ 90 with no CRITICAL/HIGH issues
2. WHEN checking quality gates THEN the system SHALL verify all facts are validated with accuracy ≥ 8/10
3. WHEN checking quality gates THEN the system SHALL verify all external links are working
4. WHEN checking quality gates THEN the system SHALL verify proper article structure exists
5. WHEN all quality gates are met THEN the agent SHALL automatically stop and finalize the article

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent system to be maintainable and debuggable so that I can monitor performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools execute THEN the system SHALL log all tool calls with parameters and results
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information with context
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track generation success rate, average steps, and completion time
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide visibility into agent decision-making and tool usage patterns
5. WHEN optimizing THEN the system SHALL track cost per article and token usage metrics

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the agent to handle project context and user permissions so that articles are generated within the correct project scope and security boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generation starts THEN the system SHALL verify user ownership of the target project
2. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL ensure project-based data isolation
3. WHEN creating articles THEN the system SHALL associate content with the correct project context
4. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
5. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL update article status within the project scope
