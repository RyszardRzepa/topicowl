# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces an article quality control system that validates generated articles against user settings and writing prompts before publication. The system will automatically check article quality during the generation process and provide specific feedback for improvements, ensuring consistent content quality and adherence to user preferences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want my generated articles to be automatically validated against my quality standards, so that I can ensure consistent content quality without manual review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an article is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically validate it against user settings and writing prompts
2. WHEN quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL return a structured list of specific issues that need to be fixed
3. WHEN no quality issues are found THEN the system SHALL return null to indicate the article meets quality standards
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL integrate seamlessly into the existing article generation workflow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want detailed feedback on what specific aspects of my article need improvement, so that I can understand and address quality issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality issues are identified THEN the system SHALL return a markdown-formatted string describing all issues
2. WHEN issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable descriptions that AI can use for corrections
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL format issues in a way that the update API can process effectively
4. WHEN no issues are found THEN the system SHALL return null instead of an empty markdown string

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the quality control system to check adherence to my writing preferences, so that all articles maintain my desired tone and style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating articles THEN the system SHALL check compliance with user-defined tone of voice settings
2. WHEN validating articles THEN the system SHALL verify adherence to specified article structure preferences
3. WHEN validating articles THEN the system SHALL ensure proper keyword integration and density
4. WHEN validating articles THEN the system SHALL validate word count against user-specified limits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the quality control system to automatically trigger article updates when issues are found, so that I don't have to manually fix every problem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically call the update article API
2. WHEN calling the update API THEN the system SHALL pass the markdown-formatted issues string for AI processing
3. WHEN the update API receives the issues THEN it SHALL use AI to interpret and fix the problems automatically
4. WHEN updates are applied THEN the system SHALL continue with the normal article generation workflow

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the quality control system to integrate seamlessly into my existing article generation process, so that it doesn't disrupt my workflow or add complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating articles THEN the quality control step SHALL be automatically included in the generation pipeline
2. WHEN quality control runs THEN it SHALL not significantly impact generation performance or user experience
3. WHEN quality control completes THEN the system SHALL continue with the next step in the generation process
4. WHEN quality control fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the quality control system to use advanced AI models for accurate validation, so that I can trust the quality assessments and recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing quality validation THEN the system SHALL use Google Gemini model for analysis
2. WHEN analyzing articles THEN the system SHALL use structured prompts that ensure consistent evaluation criteria
3. WHEN evaluating quality THEN the system SHALL consider both technical writing standards and user-specific preferences
4. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL generate actionable and specific improvement suggestions
