# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI SEO Writer is a sophisticated multi-agent system that automates the entire SEO content creation process from strategy development to final article publication. The system uses multiple AI models working in coordination to research, plan, write, and optimize SEO content at scale. It combines Google Gemini AI with grounding for search capabilities and Claude Sonnet for high-quality content writing, along with various external APIs for comprehensive SEO analysis and content optimization. The system is built using Next.js App Router with Next.js API routes for all backend functionality, providing RESTful endpoints for client-server communication without using tRPC.
