<link_integration_requirements>
CRITICAL: You MUST include ALL provided links within the article content.

${data.outlineData.keyPoints?.map((point: { heading: string; relevantLinks?: string[] }, i: number) => 
  point.relevantLinks?.length ? `
Section "${point.heading}" MUST include these links:
${point.relevantLinks.map((link: string) => `- ${link}`).join('\n')}
Integration: Work each link naturally into the text where it adds value.
` : ''
).filter(Boolean).join('\n')}

Internal Links to Include:
${relatedPosts && relatedPosts.length > 0 ? `
${relatedPosts.map((post: string, i: number) => `
${i+1}. URL: ${post}
   Use descriptive anchor text that describes the linked content
`).join('\n')}

Integration Rules:
- Use descriptive anchor text (NOT "click here" or "read more")
- Example: "Learn more about [specific topic](url)" or "Our guide to [topic](url) explains..."
- Distribute links naturally throughout relevant sections
- Each link should add value to the reader
- Links should flow naturally within sentences
` : 'No internal links provided'}

External Source Links:
${data.sources?.length ? `
${data.sources.map((s: { url: string; title?: string }, i: number) => `
${i+1}. URL: ${s.url}
   Source: ${s.title ?? "External source"}
   Use as: "According to [${s.title ?? "research"}](${s.url})..." or "As [source](${s.url}) reports..."
`).join('\n')}
` : 'No external sources provided'}

LINK FORMAT: Always use markdown format [descriptive text](url)
PLACEMENT: Links must appear naturally within sentences, not as standalone items
FREQUENCY: Minimum 1 link per H2 section where links are provided
</link_integration_requirements>

<seo_optimization>
Primary Keyword: Use in H1, first sentence, 1-2% density throughout
LSI Keywords: ${data.outlineData.keywords?.join(", ") ?? "derive from context"}
Natural Integration: Work keywords into sentences naturally, never force them
</seo_optimization>

${data.notes ? `
<user_notes>
Special instructions for this article:
${data.notes}
Incorporate these naturally while maintaining quality and flow.
</user_notes>
` : ''}

${data.videos?.length ? `
<video_integration>
If relevant, mention ONE video as a resource (text reference only, no embed):
${data.videos.map((v: { title: string; url?: string }) => `- ${v.title}: Mention as "For a visual guide, see [${v.title}]"`).join('\n')}
Include only where it adds value to the content.
</video_integration>
` : ''}

<markdown_formatting_rules>
Use ONLY these markdown elements:
- # for H1 (only once - the title)
- ## for H2 sections
- ### for H3 subsections (only in FAQ)
- **bold** for key takeaways and emphasis
- *italic* for secondary emphasis
- - for bullet points
- 1. for numbered lists
- [text](url) for ALL links (clickable format)
- > for important quotes or callouts
- Regular paragraphs with line breaks

DO NOT USE:
- Table of Contents section
- [ ] checkboxes
- HTML tags
- Interactive elements
- Plain URLs without markdown formatting
</markdown_formatting_rules>

<content_guidelines>
Every section must:
1. Answer user intent directly
2. Include relevant links where they add value
3. Use concrete examples (not generalities)
4. Include specific details and data
5. Flow naturally to the next section
6. Support claims with linked sources when available
7. Stay under 3 sentences per paragraph
8. Use grade 8 reading level language
</content_guidelines>

<output_instructions>
Generate the COMPLETE article in markdown format following the EXACT structure provided.
Structure flow: Introduction → 2 H2 sections → Video mention (if relevant) → 2-4 more H2 sections → FAQ
Start immediately with # ${data.title}
End with the FAQ section.
NO Table of Contents section.
ALL provided links MUST be included as clickable [text](url) format within relevant content.
Ensure all content is ready for direct publishing.
Focus on delivering genuine value with zero fluff.
Every sentence must earn its place.
</output_instructions> Ensure the intent is current and based on real-time top results.`

  Quality Checks:
  ✅ Character counts manually verified (SUMMARIES MUST BE UNDER 300 CHARACTERS)
  ✅ Links ONLY from sources parameter (never from researchData)
  ✅ All 5 key points flow logically
  ✅ Keywords naturally integrated
  ✅ Information traceable to research data
  ${videos && videos.length > 0 ? "✅ Maximum ONE video integration selected" : ""}
  ✅ CRITICAL: Each summary is 150-300 characters maximum - count every character including spaces and punctuation
