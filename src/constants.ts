OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT: If available videos are highly relevant, include ONE embedded YouTube video in the most contextually appropriate section.

Video Integration Instructions:
1. Analyze available videos for topic relevance to each section
2. Select the SINGLE BEST video that matches article content
3. Choose the MOST APPROPRIATE section for video placement
4. Embed video using this exact format:

## [Section Heading]

[Lead-in content explaining the topic...]

### Video: [Video Title]

[1-2 sentences explaining why this video is valuable for this section]

<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="youtube video url" 
        title="[VIDEO_TITLE]" frameborder="0" 
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
        allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

[Content that references or builds upon the video content...]

Video Selection Strategy:
- Select ONLY the most relevant video from available options
- Choose the section where video provides maximum educational impact
- Ensure video complements rather than duplicates written content
- Only include video if it genuinely enhances the article

Quality Threshold:
- Only embed video if it's highly relevant to the content
- Video should demonstrate concepts discussed in the text
- Video should be from a credible source
- Video should add clear value to the reader's understanding

Available Videos:
${data.videos.map(v => `- ${v.title}: ${v.url}`).join('\n')}

<quality_validation_requirements>
<mandatory_checks>
For each key point, verify:
✅ Heading includes target keywords naturally
✅ Summary is exactly 150-350 characters (verified by manual count)
✅ Character count field matches actual summary length
✅ Links are verified and directly relevant
✅ Selection score documented and justified
✅ Primary keywords identified and integrated
✅ Content flows logically from point to point
✅ All information traceable to research data
